		<h2><a name="sec_1">1.0</a> Installing TripleA</h2>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Installing TripleA consists of three basic steps that can be carried
				out under all platforms easily. They consist of:
				<ol>
					<li><a href="http://triplea.sourceforge.net">Downloading TripleA</a></li>
					<li>Unzipping TripleA</li>
					<li>Running TripleA</li>
				</ol>
				There are, however, only one prerequisite that one needs to fulfill
				before being able to install TripleA properly. All persons intending
				play TripleA must have a Java Virtual Machine (known as well as the JRE
				(Java Runtime Engine)) installed.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				TripleA is made to run with any Java Virtual Machine that is compliant
				to the Sun Microsystem's Java Technology. TripleA is also pre-built using
				Sun's Java 1.4.2 technology. So running TripleA on Java technology that
				does not comply to Sun's standards may not work. TripleA has been tested on
				several Java VMs such as BlackDown and the SGI and Mac OS X's ports of Sun's
				Hot Spot VM.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				As of TripleA version 0.5.2 and upwards, you can use either Java 1.5 or Java
				1.4 to run TripleA. So downloading and installing either Java VM from Sun is
				entirely up to you to decide. Below a links provided to download Java; please
				note that you only need the <b>J2SE JRE</b> package. Only developers and others
				who wish to compile TripleA from source need only get the <b>JDK</b> or <b>SDK</b>
				packages.
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp" target="_blank">Sun Java 1.5</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html" target="_blank">Sun Java 1.4</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/java/" target="_blank">Java 1.4 for Mac OS X</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.sgi.com/products/evaluation/6.5_java_plugin_1.4.1_06/" target="_blank">Java 1.4 for SGI/IRIX 6.5</a></li>

		<h2><a name="sec_1.1">1.1</a> Microsoft Windows</h2>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Assuming that you:
				<ul>
					<li>Have installed Java</li>
					<li>Downloaded TripleA</li>
				</ul>
				We can proceed to installing TripleA under the Windows platform. TripleA comes
				packaged in a compressed Zip file. You will need to extract the contents of the
				TripleA zip file somewhere on your computer (it really doesn't matter where). You
				will need a program to unzip the TripleA zip file. Most windows systems come with
				built-in zip file support which makes a zip file look like a folder with a zipper
				icon on it. For those persons who can see this, they may simply double click on the
				TripleA zip file and Windows will take over from there asking you where to unzip the
				contents of the file.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				For those persons who do not have built-in zip file support of do not wish to use
				Windows's zip file support, can use several other programs. There are several freeware
				programs such as <a href="http://www.winzip.com" target="_blank">WinZip</a> and 
				<a href="http://www.rarlabs.com" target="_blank">WinRAR</a> that allow you to zip and
				unzip files (and more!). So installing either one of those packages will allow you
				to unzip the TripleA zip file.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Once TripleA has been successfully unzipped/extracted to a specified area on the computer.
				It doesn't really matter where TripleA is extracted to, so long as you know where it has
				been extracted to, it's all that matters. Find the folder where TripleA is located. By
				default the folder name should mirror the name of the TripleA zip file:
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" width="650" height="100">
					<tr>
						<td align="center" height="10">
							<b>File Name</b>
						</td>
						
						<td align="center" height="10">
							->
						</td>
						
						<td align="center" height="10">
							<b>Folder Name</b>
						</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td align="center" valign="middle" bgcolor="#ffb6c0">
							<b>triplea_x_x_x.zip</b>
						</td>
					
						<td align="center" valign="middle">
							Would extract a folder named
						</td>
						
						<td align="center" valign="middle" bgcolor="#8fee8f">
							<b>triplea_x_x_x</b>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<br/>
				Go inside the TripleA folder using Explorer and you should see a file named
				<b>triplea_windows.bat</b> or if you have Windows configured to not display
				file extensions then you will see <b>triplea_windows</b>. This is a MS-Batch
				file which will run the TripleA start-up command in the Microsoft Console.
				Double Click on that file and TripleA will run.

		<h2><a name="sec_1.2">1.2</a> GNU/Linux, SGI/IRIX, Mac OS X</h2>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Assuming that you:
				<ul>
					<li>Have installed Java</li>
					<li>Downloaded TripleA</li>
				</ul>
				We can proceed with installing TripleA on the Linux, Irix, or Mac OS X platform.
				TripleA is packaged in a compressed zip file, to which most Unix based systems
				provide useful unzipping utilities such as the <b>unzip</b>. This is a command
				line program which is run from the console/terminal. There are others that have
				a graphical user interface but they vary from different platforms. Since <b>unzip</b>
				is common to all three Operating Systems mentioned above for this section, we shall
				focus on it.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Open the console/terminal for your platform. Go into the directory you have saved
				the TripleA zip file in. From there, run the following command:
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" width="650">
					<tr>
						<td align="left" height="48" width="48">
							<img src="images/shellscript.png" width="48" height="48" border="0" alt="shell image"/>
						</td>
						
						<td valign="middle" bgcolor="#8fee8f">
							<code>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;unzip -L triplea_x_x_x.zip
							</code>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<br/>
				
				Once TripleA has been successfully unzipped/extracted to a specified directory on the computer,
				you are now ready to run it. The unzip command above would have extracted TripleA to the current
				directory you are in. So you would see a folder of TripleA by the same name as the zip file.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" width="650" height="100">
					<tr>
						<td align="center" height="10">
							<b>File Name</b>
						</td>
						
						<td align="center" height="10">

						</td>
						
						<td align="center" height="10">
							<b>Folder Name</b>
						</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td align="center" valign="middle" bgcolor="#ffb6c0">
							<b>triplea_x_x_x.zip</b>
						</td>
					
						<td align="center" valign="middle">
							Would extract a folder named
						</td>
						
						<td align="center" valign="middle" bgcolor="#8fee8f">
							<b>triplea_x_x_x</b>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<br/>
				
				Go inside the TripleA directory and list all the contents inside:
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" width="650">
					<tr>
						<td align="left" height="48" width="48">
							<img src="images/shellscript.png" width="48" height="48" border="0" alt="shell image"/>
						</td>
						
						<td valign="middle" bgcolor="#8fee8f">
							<code>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;cd triplea_x_x_x<br/>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;ls
							</code>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<br/>
				
				You should be able to see a listing of the directory contents inside the
				TripleA directory, an example is shown below:
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" width="650">
					<tr>
						<td align="left" height="48" width="48">
							<img src="images/shellscript.png" width="48" height="48" border="0" alt="shell image"/>
						</td>
						
						<td valign="middle" bgcolor="#8fee8f">
							<code>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;bin/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doc/&nbsp;&nbsp; lib/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; triplea_mac_os_x.sh<br/>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;changelog.txt games/ license/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; triplea_unix.sh<br/>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;classes/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; icons/ readme.html triplea_windows.bat<br/>
							</code>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<br/>
				From here you will need to execute the shell script file that suits your operating
				system. If you are running Mac OS X then you will need to run the <b>triplea_mac_os_x.sh</b>
				script, and if your running GNU/Linux, SGI/Irix or any other UNIX variant then you must
				run the <b>triplea_unix.sh</b> file. Before attempting to run them, you will need to change
				the file permissions first (this applies to both Macs and Unix). Below are both the commands
				to change the file permission and the command to run it:
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" width="650">
					<tr>
						<td align="left" height="48" width="48">
							<img src="images/shellscript.png" width="48" height="48" border="0" alt="shell image"/>

							<code>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;chmod +x triplea_unix.sh<br/>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;./triplea_unix.sh
							</code>
						</td>

				</table>
				<br/>
				Thats all there is to running TripleA!

		<h2><a name="sec_2">2.0</a> The Main User Interface</h2>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				TripleA's user interface consists of a collection of 1 or more tabs. By default there
				are 2 tabs present: <b>Game</b> and <b>Properties</b>. The game tab gives a brief
				description of what game your running and what engine version your using. This being
				said, the game tab is divided into 3 sections: <b>Game Type</b>, <b>File</b>, and

				Every game will have a properties tab where an arbitrary number of property
				options are available. Usually these options will somehow affect how the game
				will be played. Once a game file is loaded, the properties tab will appear. In
				TripleA's case, it will remember the last game file you loaded so there will
				always be a pre-loaded game file, thus the properties tab will show under any
				circumstance.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Below are provided 2 screen shots of the how the properties tabs would look like
				in TripleA if the A&A Classic Edition (Fig 2.0.3) and A&A Revised Edition (Fig 2.0.4)

		<h2><a name="sec_2.4">2.4</a> Play By EMail Game (PBEM)</h2>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				TripleA's Play By EMail mode allows persons to play a game via EMail without having
				to be connected to each other online. PBEM also allows players more time to think over
				various moves they have to do and ideal for those persons who live under strict time
				constraints, and cannot spend hours and hours online playing games.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				TripleA's PBEM mode has advantages and disadvantages, to which the advantages out weigh
				the latter. They are as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>Advantages of PBEM</li>
					<ol>
						<li>More time to think out moves</li>
						<li>Only need to come online to send your turn to the next player</li>
						<li>Dice rolls are done by a dedicated dice server that is independent of TripleA</li>
						<li>All dice rolls are PGP Verified and email to every player</li>
						<li>Every move and every dice roll is logged and saved in TripleA's History Window</li>
						<li>An online game can be later continued under PBEM mode</li>
						<li>Hard for others to cheat</li>
					</ol>
					<br/>
					<li>Disadvantages of PBEM</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Cannot save and mail your turn while in the middle of a battle sequence</li>
						<li>Casualties for both sides during a battle must be selected by the person currently playing</li>
					</ol>
				</ul> 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A PBEM game can be initiated in 10 steps shown below:
				<ol>
					<li>Start up TripleA</li>
					<li>Select "PBEM" from the <b>game type</b> menu</li>
					<li>Select the PBEM saved file that an opponent sent you
					    or begin a new PBEM game, from the <b>file</b> menu</li>
					<li>Click on the "PBEM" tab</li>
					<li>Enter the email addresses of the persons involved in the PBEM game (including your own)</li>
					<li>Click the "Test EMail" button to make sure the Dice Server is up and running and
					    that the emails you entered are valid.</li>
					<li>Start the game by pressing the <b>Play</b> button</li>
					<li>Play your turn</li>
					<li>Save your game at the end of your turn</li>
					<li>EMail your saved game to your opponent</li>

				Here are some "Practical Guidelines" for playing PBEM with TripleA
				that has been contributed by the <a href="http://maddlinks.com/triplea/index.php?s=39487372bc64dd5f8bbd2c17e17d6221&showforum=12" target="_blank">TripleA PBEM community</a>.
				They address certain issues such as what to do during battles and file naming conventions.
				<blockquote>
					<h3>Practical Guidelines for PBEM</h3>
					<p>
						Playing TripleA over the net allows for continuous Axis and Ally game play. With it, you don’t
						need five or six hours dedicated to one game. You can participate in a game whenever you can.
						You can even start a game via the Client / Server model and continue it via PBE.  You can exchange
						the save game file via instant messenger, FTP server, or email and pick it back up in a Client /
						Server game whenever you can.  Here are some general guidelines to help you keep your game play going.
					</p>

					<p>
						<h4>Selecting Casualties</h4>
						When selecting casualties you should follow an agreed guideline. 
						A common guideline is to select casualties according to the cost of the piece.  
						For land units it would follow this order:  Infantry, Artillery, Armor, Fighters, Bombers.  
						When losing a bomber in a land battle it would do well to consider the interest of your opponent.  
						If you would lose the bomber before a fighter to hold onto the territory then do that with your opponent’s
						best interest in mind
					</p>

					<p>
						Continuing the example for sea battles, casualties would be selected in this order:  Transports, Submarines,
						Fighters, Destroyers, Loaded Transports, Carriers, Battleships.  Submersible submarines give exception; if a
						submarine is by itself or with empty transports then it submerges on the first round.
					</p>
			
					<h4>Types of PBEM play</h4>
			
					<p>
						<b>Standard PBEM</b>: this kind of game is described in the TripleA documentation.  You select the PBEM option
						and enter your email address and your opponents email address.  If there is more than two involved in the
						game you enter your email address and the email address of the person whose turn follows yours.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						<b>Confirmable PBEM</b>: we use this kind of game to keep the game easy on our inbox.  You select the PBEM
						option but you use the groups email address.  Create one email address for your group and send all dice
						rolls to that address (use it for both email fields).  The group moderator should have the password to
						this email account.  This way dice rolls can still be confirmed if they are called into question and no
						inboxes get flooded with dice results.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						<b>Trust Game</b>:  In this game we do not use the PBE option.
					</p>
			
					<p>
						<h4>Naming Schemes</h4>
						Once your turn is complete you send the save game file to the other players. It is helpful to use a
						descriptive naming scheme. An example is using the first initial of every player round – turn and
						version info. For instance if nabiy, underdog, and drec were playing version 0.4.6 and it was Russia’s
						turn in the second round of play the name of the file should be: <b>nud2-1RS046.svg</b>

		<h2><a name="sec_8">8.0</a> Game Properties</h2>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Each game that runs with the TripleA engine is allowed to have various properties
				applied to the game. These properties are hard-coded into the game and can be turned
				activated / deactivated or completely omitted from games. Below is a table of game 
				property specifications written by Ali Ibrahim:

		<h2><a name="sec_8.1">8.1</a> Low Luck</h2>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				 Low luck is a methodology for rolling dice which reduces the variance inherent in
				 dice rolling. It guarantees that the number of hits in a certain set of rolls will
				 not differ from the average number of hits by more than one. The details of the
				 implementation as well as a general discussion of low luck can be found in the
				 DAAK club at <a href="http://www.daak.de/aarll/aarllregel.php?sprache=e">http://www.daak.de/aarll/aarllregel.php?sprache=e</a>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				 The low luck option can be enabled by putting a check mark in the box next to
				 &quot;Low Luck&quot; in the properties tab before the game is started. This
				 option must be specified by the server in a multi player game. Low luck has
				 not been tested for PBEM games. The current implementation does not support
				 low luck rolling for SBR's or techs, instead normal rules are used in these
				 two cases. The number of dice rolled in a phase of a battle should never be
				 more than one. The number of hits will be indicated at the bottom of the
				 combat window and will be equal to the number of guaranteed hits plus one
				 if the only dice rolled is a hit. No dice may be rolled if the outcome is
				 guaranteed because no fractional dice are needed.<br/>

		<h2><a name="sec_9">9.0</a> F.A.Q</h2>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<b>Q: </b>I am using windows and I keep getting &quot;Bad command or file name&quot; what do I do?<br/>

				<b>A: </B>You haven’t installed or set up the java virtual machine correctly. Go to <a href="#sec_1">Installing TripleA</a>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>Q: </b>I am a Linux or Mac OS X user and I keep getting &quot;Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: games/strategy/engine/framework/GameRunner&quot;<br/>
				<b>A: </b>This error occurs when there are no compiled classes for java to run. In other words, you might
				         have accidently downloaded the source package instead of the pre-compiled package.
			</p>

			
			<p>
				<b>Q: </b>I get &quot;Unable to create server socket: Connection timed out: connect&quot;!<br/>
				<b>A: </b>This basically means TripleA could not find the server to connect to. Are you behind
				a Firewall that is blocking you? Is the server behind a Firewall blocking your connections? Is
				your router set up properly for Port Forwarding? Or maybe the server went offline.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>Q: </b>No matter how many times I re-download TripleA, it keeps saying it is corrupted!<br/>

				<b>A: </b>Try using a different UnZipping utility. If that doesn't work try re-downloading TripleA
				using a different program. There was a case where Mozilla browser kept saving the Zip file in a 
				corrupted state.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>Q: </b>Don't ask me how.. but I can't seem to turn on the AI, how can I do it manually?<br/>
				<b>A: </b>Visit this <a target="_blank" href="http://maddlinks.com/triplea/index.php?showtopic=184">link</a>
			</p>

			
			<p>
				<b>Q: </b>What can I do if I spot a SeaZone connection problem and want to fix it fast?<br/>
				<b>A: </b>You can edit the XML game file manually as shown <a target="_blank" href="http://maddlinks.com/triplea/index.php?showtopic=301">here</a>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>Q: </b>How do I report a bug?<br/>

				<b>A: </b>Report bugs either on the <a target="_blank" href="http://maddlinks.com/triplea">TripleA message board</a> or at the <a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/triplea">Project home page.</a>
				when doing so please follow this <a target="_blank" href="http://maddlinks.com/triplea/index.php?showtopic=162">Bug Reporting guide</a>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>Q: </b>Any way of getting an observer in the game?<br/>

				<b>A: </b>Yes, by having the observer connect to your game and not selecting any countries.
				You can have many observers. One warning. They cannot leave during the middle of the game!
				If they do, it will halt the game and crash (not really crash but you guys would have to
				start over from a saved game).
