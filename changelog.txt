* Added new button to main screen, "Rule Book...", which will open up the user's default web browser and go to the triplea sf page with our future rulebook. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Updated "unitProduction" so when used in conjunction with "Damage From Bombing Done To Units Instead Of Territories" it sets the allowed number of units to be produced in that territory, thereby finally un-associating the PU production of a territory from the Unit production of a territory.
  Also, updated "production" to automatically set "unitProduction" to be equal. So if you want a different unitProduction value, you must set it after production when attaching to a territory. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Removed String .isEmpty calls, as they are not supported under Java 1.5, also called java 5. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed fighters and air disappearing even if you bought a carrier, if there is another turn like china, between yours and the placement of the carrier. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan]) 

* Fixed paratrooper loading creating multiple copies of units. Fixed bugs for deselection of paratroopers and air. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed moore AI and easy AI to use new repairing method when trying to repair unit damage instead of territory damage. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Some updates for Dynamix AI, and fixed AI bug caused by more than one map was opened per TripleA instance, and Added a Resource Collection Increaser cheat. (wisconsin)

* Finished making repair rules work for both damage done to units and damage done to territories. 
  A note to map makers: repair rules should mention the actual unit, not a _hit version of the unit.  This means all repair rules that mention "factory_hit" will need to be changed to mention "factory". (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Initial work on making repair rules work for damage done to units. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed null pointer in moore ai for games which don't have carriers. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added method to unit class to find territory unit is in. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed moore AI and easy AI to not purchase any unit which has consumesUnits. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed bug in scrambling code where user was not being asked if they want to scramble. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed infinite loop introduced into original factory owner check. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added new unit attachment, canProduceUnits, which allows a unit to produce other units, without being a factory. Therefor we can now have combat factories, flying factories, or aa gun factories, or w/e. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added the developer forum and the war club to the lobby help menu. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added tool tips for units to battle calculator. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed null pointer caused by using .getOwner().getData()  and a word to anyone else who ever thinks about using this: don't, it causes null pointers if there are any neutrals, since neutral is a null player. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Created new unit attachment, requiresUnits, which allows units to be placed only when certain units are in the territory. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Changed it so that Territory production defaults to Zero instead of 2, and that unitProduction gets set to a territory's production, though you can still set unitProduction manually if you set it AFTER you set production. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Created new unit attachment, consumesUnits, which allows units to be upgraded or placed on top of other units. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Created new unit attachment, canOnlyBePlacedInTerritoryValuedAtX, which defaults to -1 meaning can be placed anywhere. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Expanded 'disabled' logic to include airbases, repairsUnits, givesMovement, and combat units. Disabled units will not provide their abilities, like scrambling, movement, or repairing, to other units.  Disabled combat units will not participate in combat, and will be destroyed if captured. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Created the placement logic for canProduceXUnits, which now works properly. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed display error where units with unit damage were not having their damage amount displayed. Still some bugs though for groups of units. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Created new unit attachment, canDieFromReachingMaxDamage, which will cause a unit to die if they reach max damage through strat bombing or rockets. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed bug in triggers that caused unit production damage to be done to a territory if a factory was placed via triggers. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Allowed rockets to also damage a unit, rather than a territory.  Further work on getting unit damage to work and display properly. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Made disabled units actually work. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed bugs introduced into Strategic Bombing. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Created new global property, "Damage From Bombing Done To Units Instead Of Territories", which when ON will have damage be done to units rather than territories, as territory damage was the old way of doing things. 
  In order for this to work, you must have "SBR Affects Unit Production" turned OFF, as that is the trigger for per territory damage. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Created "canProduceXUnits" unit attachment. Set to "-1" if you want to produce the value of the territory the unit is in. Still working on the code for this. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Removed "isCombatInfrastructure" and "unitDamage" from unit attachments, and also removed m_maxOperationalDamage from TripleAUnits. Unit damage is per unit, not per unit type, so it should never be a unit attachment. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Stopped both Moore AI and Easy AI from buying any units that have maxBuildRestrictions. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added lobby rules web page to list of web pages available from the new help menu in the lobby screen. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed null pointer in unit drawer. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fix for Moore AI, it was choosing to never ever attack neutrals in some situations, even if they blocked the path towards the enemy. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Abstracting MovePanel class. (frigoref)

* Removing constants that refer to specific units, as we should be using unit attachments instead.  Also minor updates to unit attachment's new toString. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added "Reset" button to Map Zoom. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Allowed for more information about units to be displayed as a tool tip on the territory panel. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Created new toString in unit attachment to only display important information that is different from a default unit with no attachments. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixes for various null pointer errors. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* New unit attachment setter, "unitPlacementOnlyAllowedIn", which is the direct inverse of "unitPlacementRestrictions". (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed issue [bug 3294118] where transports drop their ground units in the ocean when they engage in combat. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added new global property, "On Entering Units Destroyed Instead Of Captured", which if true allows units normally captured on entering to be destroyed.  Does not affect non-combat units, only affects combat units with the canBeCapturedOnEnteringBy attachment. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])


Changes for 1.3.0.0
* Added the new username banning system, which will help a lot on the lobby. Like to ban offensive usernames without necessarily banning the player. (wisconsin)

* Another patch for Dynamix AI (wisconsin)

* Added airfield_disabled.png and harbour_disabled.png for all nations (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Flipped all unit graphics. All axis sea and air point left, while allies point right (except russian air points left).  All ground units for a country point same direction, left for japan and russia, right for everyone else. Non-combat units and aaGuns do not point any direction, or are same for all nations. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed Neutrals charge to work properly, without java errors, if the neutral is attacked and there is a battle. Will now display a message in history panel if there is not enough PUs to remove. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Determine if units are 'disabled' and display a unique icon for them (ComradeKev)

* Initial work on Scrambling aircraft (ComradeKev)

* Fixed bug in StrongAI/MooreAI where it would never attack a player if it lost too much TUV, and the TUV calc thought the enemy had zero TUV. Also fixed bug where it calced for the offensive value of walk in territories, instead of defensive value. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added a global property, "Capture Units On Entering Territory", which if true allows units to be captured instead of fighting. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added new player attachment, captureUnitOnEnteringBy, which will allow this player to let some of the units be captured when a territory is taken over. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added new territory attachment, captureUnitOnEnteringBy, which will allow units in the territory to be taken when the territory is captured. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added new unit attachment, canBeCapturedOnEnteringBy, which will allow a unit to be taken when the territory is captured. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Changed Strategic Bombing to account for isSuicide units. Now isSuicide units will also die if they strategic bomb something. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed error unit display of unit graphics, where things that were _hit needed _it on the end instead of front, sometimes resulting in needing _it_hit_it, etc. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed null pointer in game data getNeighbors match. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Updating default maps to use latest properties. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Rewrote entire RulesAttachment.java so that territory conditions could use "count" with options like "original", "controlled", etc. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added new rule property option, "map", for use with Presence and Exclusion conditions. If used, it will return the entire map's territories. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Made it so that jet power technology and super subs technology no longer affect units with zero attack and zero defense. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Completely re-wrote checkUnitExclusions and Made unitPresence work with directExcludedTerritories, alliedExclusionTerritories, enemyExclusionTerritories, enemySurfaceExclusionTerritories. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added new rule property and condition/objective, "directExcludedTerritories", which applies to the attached player. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added new rule property and condition/objective, "unitPresence", as well as "directPresenceTerritories", "alliedPresenceTerritories", and "enemyPresenceTerritories". 
  unitPresence is a unit and count for that unit, which must be used with a presence territories to determine if there are those units in those territories or not. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added new trigger option, "conditionType", which can be set to AND, OR, XOR. This option defines the relationship conditions in a trigger must have, when there is more than 1 condition in the trigger. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed bug in triggers where an inverted trigger would activate when it should not, when one condition was false but another true. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added the ability for any construction of type ending in "structure" not to be changed by setting global values for unlimited/more constructions. Also fixed issue with submarine suicide units able to attack aircraft. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Updating UnitImageFactory to not rely on hardcoded unit names. Now any unit with isAA unit attachment will require _r and _rockets and _rockets_r IF you have those technologies.  Same applied for new aa gun rules and factories. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added new unit attachment, isRocket, which will turn the unit into a rocket when the player has the rocket technology, without the unit being an AA gun.  
  If the unit is named exactly "aaGun" then it will require an image called "rockets".  If the unit is named anything else, then it will require an image with "_rockets" appended to its original name. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added new unit attachment, isAAmovement, which when true the unit will follow the rules specified for movement of an AA gun, even if it is not an AA gun, or is a special kind of AA gun. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed issue where battle calc calls with AA units was generating divide by zero. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed bug where battles never ended between units with zero attack/defense power. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added new menu option during a game, "Roll Dice...", in the "Game" drop down menu. It allows a player to roll as many dice, with any dice sides, that they want, independant from playing the game. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added new unit attachments, <option name="isAAforCombatOnly" value="true"/> and <option name="isAAforBombingThisUnitOnly" value="true"/>, allow units to be AA guns for only certain attack types. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added new unit attachments, <option name="attackAAmaxDieSides" value="6"/> and <option name="attackAA" value="1"/>, which allow you to independently set the attack values and max dice sides for AA units. Radar Tech changed to add "1" to the attack values. 
  Attack values, including radar, may never go above half of the max dice sides. All attack values (with and without radar) should divide into diceSides without any remainder, otherwise the players will get errors during LowLuck. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed a bug where a player with both Mechanized Infantry and Paratroopers technology could no longer do any mechanized infantry movement because the validator was checking for paratroopers first. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Created Low Luck for Strategic Bombing and Rockets. New global property, "Low Luck for Bombing and Territory Damage", and new Unit Attachments, bombingMaxDieSides and bombingBonus. Can be used to set different values for strategic bombing and rocket attacks, separate from the rest of the game. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added new unit attachment, <option name="givesMovement" value="1:fighter"/>, and global property, "Units May Give Bonus Movement", which allow units to give movement to other units. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed edit mode to allow changing ownership of sea territories, so long as it is not un-owned. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed convoy zone movement validation, and created new global property to manage it: "Naval Units May Not NonCombat Move Into Controlled Sea Zones". Previously was disallowing moves into convoy zones during non-combat, and was marking transported land units as having been in battle. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Updates to Pact of Steel 2, so that Japanese make use of isKamikaze and isSuicide. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added new unit attachment, isKamikaze, which will allow an air unit to use up all of its movement to go to a battle, if it wants to. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fix for bug 3052260, Ww2v2 revised subs should now roll dice correctly, instead of dying prematurely in cases where the enemy has a destroyer. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed suicide units combat to take into account subs and destroyers. Follows relatively simple rules compared with normal combat. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Created new global property, "Defending Suicide and Munition Units Do Not Fire", which when true will stop defending suicide units from acting like suicide units: dying first round, shooting before everyone else. 
  So if true, defending suicide units act like normal units, however they still can not be taken casualty to attacks by other suicide units. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed various matches and places in the code to do with non-combat units, so that they will now also include isInfrastructure. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Finished work on isSuicide, and also created new game property, "Suicide and Munition Casualties Restricted", which stops casualties from returning fire if true. 
  Please be aware that the the code in MustFightBattle for these two new features needs to be double checked, especially for multiplayer games. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Beginning work on unit attachment "isSuicide", which will allow a unit to die at the beginning of combat. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Changed "isInfrastructure" to NOT be bombable. Made it so that "canBeDamaged" is now the switch to make something bombable. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Changed "isInfrastructure" to be captured when taken.  isInfrastructure will now be used in place of the planned 'isNonCombat'. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added new unit attachment, destroyedWhenCapturedBy, which is a list of players who would destroy a unit rather than capture it. New global property to activate it, "Units Can Be Destroyed Instead Of Captured". (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added new unit attachment, maxBuiltPerPlayer, which limits the number of a unittype that can be built for each player. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added history entries for many triggers. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Updated ui and utilities to allow islands to be selectable if they are inside a sea zone that ends or begins with "Sea Zone". Previously only allowed water territories to end with, not begin with "Sea Zone". (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Updated giveUnits and takeUnits to not throw Java errors for older maps. Not backwards compatible, just ignore it if true or false. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Dice change: now allows max dice sides to be set in the xml, <diceSides value="6"/>. Defaults to 6 if not present. Can be any number between 1 and 200. This will allow many new types of games to be made. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan] and gansito)

* Bug fix in Trigger Attachments Tech change, was disqualifying techs based on attached player instead of aPlayer. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Redid canBeGivenByTerritoryTo unit attachment to be a colon delimited list of players, who are the players this unit can be given to. Also added a missing toString. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Completely redid giveUnitControl to be flexible. giveUnitControl and changeUnitOwners are now lists of players to give to, and a new unit attachment, canBeGivenByTerritory, and a new global property, "Give Units By Territory".  
  takeUnitControl is deleted since no longer needed. This will break compatibility with 2 maps, but I have already updated them, so users just have to update their maps after the next version comes out. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan], with some inspiration from rolflarsson)

* New game property, "Triggered Victory", and new trigger option, "victory" value = victory message. Can be based on any condition. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Dynamix AI patch, various small improvements and logic fixes. (wisconsin)

* New game property, "Low Luck for Technology", which will apply low luck rules to rolling for tech. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Dynamix AI logging patch, should make logs easier to read. (wisconsin)

* Completely re-wrote NoPuDelegate, and re-wrote the Rules Attachment for productionPerXTerritories. Now looks like: <option name="productionPerXTerritories" value="infantry" count="2"/>, and you can have multiple instances of this. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Small bug fix for Support attachments (squiddaddy), and a bug fix for the new placement logic. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Dynamix AI patch, adding more features and improving some logic. (wisconsin)

* New Repair options. New unit attachment: <option name="repairsUnits" value="battleship:bunker"/> will cause the attached unit to repair units in the list. New game properties: "Battleships repair at beginning of round" and "Two HitPoint Units Require Repair Facilities". (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Created 2 new autosaves: autosave_round_even and autosave_round_odd, which will autosave at the beginning of each round. Provides only the last 2 rounds in order to keep file spam to a minimum. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* New Carrier-Fighter interleaver for AI casualty selection.  Another patch for Dynamix AI. (wisconsin)

* Fixed bug where the NoPuPurchase delegate was calling the normal Purchase delegate if the player had PUs left over, Resulting in the player getting multiple purchase screens. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* New game property, "Unit Placement Restrictions", and new Unit Attachment option, <option name="unitPlacementRestrictions" value="territory1:territory2"/>, prevent a unit or units from being placed in any given territory. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Beginning work on Unit Placement Restrictions. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Moore AI's casualty picking fixed to work with all maps, not just ww2vX maps. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Caching of game data to speed up dynamix ai and multiple battle calcing in one turn.  And another patch for Dynamix AI. (wisconsin)

* Added new method for Moore AI to move unused transports back to factories. (wisconsin)

* Fix for Moore AI moving units towards capitals already conquered, and not letting units leave once they get there. (wisconsin)

* Fix for Null Pointer error in Moore AI's factory movement. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fix for Null Pointer error in Moore AI's movePlanesHomeNonCom. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fix for Moore AI's horrible purchasing of transportable land units, which often resulted in the purchase of no land units. This also fixes the 'moore ai buying too many sea transports' issue. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added new method for Moore AI to move landlocked units to coastal territories if amphibious (wisconsin), and fixed the purchasing of Transports to purchase land when needed and transports when needed, hopefully without over-purchasing either. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added new option for alliedExclusionTerritories: "controlledNoWater", which will not count water or impassible territories. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Major patch for Dynamix AI. Updated battle calc to cache sorted casualty lists. (wisconsin)

* Moore AI purchases tweaking and speeding up. Will no longer consider for purchasing units with zero movement, units with 3 or more attack than defense or defense than attack, 
  and units with zero defense, and sea units with 1 movement, if there are 2 movement sea units available. Also now records when it purchases transports in getDidPurchaseTransports(). (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Null Pointer Exception fix in StrongAI transporting. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Moore AI fixes for previous update. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Moore AI will now bid single units to territories, and bid to all it territories before cycling over to bid to the first one again. Starts with territories touching the enemy. Also fixed a bug in SUtils.distanceToEnemy(). (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* MustFightBattle was removing all movement from all units (including air) that stopped to kill an undefended transport, and should not remove movement of air units. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Moore AI and Weak AI fixes, they were not repairing any factories when they had multiple damaged factories. Both will now repair correctly, and limit repairs to half of total PUs, and limit individual factories to a repair of one quarter total PUs. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Moore AI fixes, will now return immediately if it has nothing to do for moves and purchasing (wisconsin), and will now repair damaged factories correctly (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan]).

* Moore AI major fix, was considering defender's attack values instead of defense values under some circumstances. Formula to remove casualty units was returning the list as is without properly sorting first,

* Moore AI SUtils getExactNeighbors() fix, was returning incorrect data for any distance greater than 2. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Moore AI logic fix, calculations for taking enemy capitol with allied help included owned strength when looking at allied strength, also 
  getExactNeighbors was returning incorrect data by not fully removing previous iterations (getExactNeighbors still returns incorrect data if distance > 2). (squidbait)

* Easy AI major fix, was considering all water territories on the map in the list of territories to attack with land units. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Easy AI will now purchase units for bid, however it will only purchase land units, and only place them in the capitol. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Easy AI bug fix, was purchasing zero units when it had to repair a factory and also had at least 1 other factory with no repairs. Also fixed AI not using all of its money when it had enough left to buy one more unit.  (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Fixed Moore AI not puchasing anything when it has placeanywhere rules and no factories, and fixed it placing everything inside a capitol which is impassable (bug 2965154), 
and fixed a list which was growing indefinitely each round with duplicates, the AI will no longer place in any impassible territory, the AI will not attempt to place factories in territories just conquered, 
and also made further tweaks to the AI (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan]).

* More work on Moore AI's purchasing and placing. Will now sort territories into a list which represents both production ability and closeness to enemy.
AI is now discouraged from buying submarines. And AI will now attempt to buy a factory if it has no factories. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Added a swap sides button to the battle calculator, corrected a misspelled class, and reduced default calcs from 5000 to 3000 (dav_eagle)

* Moore AI purchase fixes. AI was buying factories then trying to place them in water. When rich it was purchasing only the cheapest unit (bug 2989178), 
and even when it was supposed to it was not buying any factories. Tried to purchase all air way too often. Was attempting to place factories it did not have. 
Was purchasing specialty units like walls, bunkers, and mortars, way too often. Was not buying factories if the enemy had any units within 3 territories of potential factory territory.
And lots of small tweaks to purchasing algorithm to allow moore ai to work for more maps other than ww2v3, especially bigger maps. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])

* Moore AI logic fix, will now attack alone transports correctly, and some small tweaks (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan] & wisconsin)
