### Things we track in github issues
- game bugs: existing functionality that simply does not work as advertised (game rule violation, errors, etc)
- feature requests: anything a person would like added to the game
- discussion threads: conversations that identify tasks and aim to come to a community consensus on issues. The outcome of discussion threads will be ideally a number of focused "task threads"
- task threads: These are TODO items, likely they will be labelled as feature requests, but they can also be code improvements or what not. The key element to task threads is that they will be nugget sized projects that are well defined and ready to go. Exactly what is needed is defined in the task description, and we've also defined what exactly we expect to be completed when the task is done.
