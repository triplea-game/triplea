# Documentation

If you are looking for a way to contribute to the TripleA project, please read [Contribute to TripleA](contribute.md).

It is a goal to have all TripleA documentation in the '/docs' folder.

Documentation is broadly organized by two top level folders, first by audience, second by documentation type.

## Documentation Audience

**admin**: documentation useful for the project maintainers and admins. Will include topics such as 'how to release'

**development**: related to coding, code design, how to build

**map-making**: intended for map makers, topics around map making and XML building

**project**: general documentation around the TripleA project that describes project process, how to contribute, how to
engage, where to communicate

**infrastructure**: relates to software deployment and operations, eg: bot setup, server setup, checking logs, checking
and restarting services

## Documentation Types

**tutorial / getting-started**: explanatory instructions intended to teach.
Look here when getting started.

**how-to**: cut and dry step-by-step instructions on how to do something

**reference**: description of a topic or a process (e.g.: encyclopedia entry)

**background**: explanation of how something came to be (e.g.: design or a decision doc)
