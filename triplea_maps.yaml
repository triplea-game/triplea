# This file is read live by the game whenever you click 'download maps'. Updating this file on the
# github server will have immediate effect on all game installations. Be careful to not break old
# game engine versions when adding new fields (but note, unrecognized yaml field names are simply ignored)
#
#
# Map Property Descriptions:
#
# mapName: This is the name of your map as it would be presented on the map download screen
#        NOTE: there is a constraint on your map name and repo name. When your map name is converted
#              to all lower case, and spaces replaced with underscore, it must match the repository name.
#        IE, for:  https://github.com/triplea-maps/hex_globe10/archive/master.zip
#               The map name may be: "Hex Globe10", or "Hex_Glob10"
#               But the map name may NOT be: "HexGlobe10", or "Hex Globe 10"
#
# url: This is the location where a map zip can be downloaded. This should be a location on github and
#      should be pretty similar to any of the other map downaod URLs
#
# version: The map download version, used by the game to determine if an existing map is out of date.
#          The game engine uses the map version number found in XML for any other usages (yeah, that is confusig.)
#          Just know that this is *only* used by the download screen for determining if a map is out of date.
#          The game keeps track of the current map version downloaded in the extra .properties file that is created
#          in addition to every map file downloaded
#
# description: HTMl description of the map. This description appears in the map download window. The map title
#         and image are printed automatically and do not need to be included in the description

    <br>2 Variants of 270BC
    <br>
    <br>270BC Cernel Variant (by Cernel)
    <br>  A low level reworking of 270BC, mainly to rebalance the units and redefine the round 1 gameplay dynamics.
    <br>  It can be seen as an unofficial new version of 270BC, close to the original.
    <br>
    <br>270BC 40% (by Cernel)
    <br>  A mod of "270BC Cernel Variant" (see above) where starting units, productions and the city cost are decreased to about 40%. The ruleset is, otherwise, the same as "270BC Cernel Variant".
    <br>  Aims at keeping closely the gameplay of the original, but with fewer units.
    <br>  It is an easy to learn and play (but not so easy to master) game, with a detailed suggestions section in notes, written to aid new players.
    <br>  Special thanks to guerrilla_J, Dany, epinikion for high quality testing (hopefully the game is well balanced, both for dice and low luck).

      <li>Unit upkeep costs: troops consume supplies every turn.</li>
      <li>Unit fuel costs: troops consume require supplies to campaign.</li>
      <li>Blockade causes inflation and reduces resource production.</li>
      <li>Low force-to-space-ratio: relatively small stacks roaming the vast American lands, especially in the West.</li>

    <br>
    <br>1) Diplomacy
    <br>This is as close as TripleA lets us come to the real Diplomacy board game. Uses some complex rules, be sure to read the game notes.
    <br>
    <br>2) Diplomacy: FFA V3 Rules
    <br>This is the Diplomacy map of Europe, with ww2v3 units and rules.  Easy to learn.
    <br>
    <br>3) Diplomacy: FFA Great War Style
    <br>This is the Diplomacy map of Europe, with "Great War" units.  Also very easy to learn.
    <br>
    <br>4) Diplomacy: WW1
    <br>Unlike the other 3, this is a normal non-ffa game.  It pits Germany, Austria, and Turkey, against France, England, and Russia.  (Italy is neutral)
        It uses Diplomacy style units, Armies and Navies, with 3 territory types: Land, Sea, and Coastal.

    <br>
    <br>This is an 18 player FFA map with all players neutral to each other at the start.  Players can change their political
    <br>stance toward other nations, from neutral to cooperative, friendly, aligned and allied or to uncooperative,
    <br>unfriendly, hostile, and permanent war.  Every nation starts with the same units but a different geographic
    <br>in a completely custom world.
    <br>
    <br>Grow your population, build cities and factories, expand militarily, and use diplomacy to advance your
    <br>nation to supremacy.  Develop nuclear capabilities, control the seas, and use canals to out-manuever your
    <br>enemies.  Units fight and move differently depending on terrain.  Use generals and admirals.
    <br>Neutral units control most of the land at the start, some are very difficult to defeat.  
    <br>In addition to resources from gaining territory, use merchant ships to gain income from trade.

    <br>a.) Content:
    <br>Includes 2 scenarios of Big World 2
    <br>Big World 2 : Balance of Power
    <br>Big World 2 : Rise of the Axis
    <br>
    <br>b.) Rough overview:
    <br>This is a World War 2 themed global map like ww2v3, ww2 revised, Big World 1942 and TWW. This is an averaged sized map. The game play is slower than ww2v3 and ww2 revised, but far faster than NWO and TWW. The game can be decided as quickly as round 6 (appromimately 3 hours) but could sometimes drag on to rounds 10+ between experienced players.
    <br>
    <br>Features common in both scenarios
    <br>- give players a choice of v3 style or NWO/revised style transport and submarine rules.
    <br>- automatically balances starting position under either v3 style or revised rules
    <br>- optional national objectives for extra income
    <br>- optional national advatages for unique units or abilities
    <br>- optional balanced techs. Each tech is more-or-less balanced so that no single tech is overpowered.
    <br>- been in development since 2011, playtested over 4 years for balance.
    <br>
    <br>Big World 2 : Balance of Power
    <br>This map develops from Big World : 1942 v3 rules by Prussia, Veqryn, Bung, Pulicat et al. The scenario is set at the turning point of WW2 with the battles of Stalingrad and Midway imminent. Experienced players on Big World : 1942 or its variants should have very little problem playing this map. Playable nations are Russia, Germany, Britain, Italy, China, Japan and USA.
    <br>
    <br>Big World 2: Rise of the Axis
    <br>This is a 1939 scenario. One Unique feature is the inclusion of the French, who are likely to survive until at least the second round. It is more cost-efficient for Germany to capture Poland before France. Other historical events such as Germany's Axis alliance, Vichy France Surrender and Pearl Harbor are also depicted. This map offers a great variety of strategies for the Axis.
    <br>
    <br>c.) General tips:

    <br> <b><em>by Veqryn</em></b>
    <br>
    <br>May 31, 1916, the two greatest navies in the world set sail to meet in the greatest and only full-scale clash of battleships in history.
    <br>The German High Seas Fleet planned to use its scouting battlecruisers to draw the Royal Navy's battlecruiser group of the Grand Fleet into a trap and
        destroy it before the rest of the Grand Fleet could arrive.  The Royal Navy seeked to cut the germans off from their port, then use their numerical
        advantage to annihilate the Germans.
    <br>
    <br><b>TO WIN:</b>
    <br>Move an Admiral (your flag) into the enemy's capital.
    <br>You can do this by defeating your enemy's navy, or by sneaking around it with a fast task force.
    <br>Conquer the convoy zones to slowly turn the tide against your enemy (most worth 10 PUs each, some worth 20 PUs).
    <br>
    <br><b>HOW TO PLAY:</b>
    <br>This is a tactical game, which means each piece represents a single ship, instead of a navy.
    <br>Each nation is broken up into 2 players: Movement and Armament (Attack).
    <br>The Movement player first moves all of that nations ships around, as well as buying and placing any new ships, Then the Attack player moves
        the Shells, Torpedos, and Depth Charges to attack the enemy ships.  The Attack player is simulating the ships firing their weapons at the enemy.
    <br>The armament (ammunition) used to attack the enemy is used up in the first round of battle and 'dies'.
    <br>Then, the Armament player then simulates the ships reloading their weapons, by placing new ammunition on each ship.
    <br>
    <br>In order to make this a tactical game, we need to give players a good reason to spread out their fleets.
        Here are 2 very good reasons to spread out your ships:
    <br>1. You can only Reload (Place) up to 2 new shells/ammunition per turn PER HEX (any, every, and all hexes).
    <br>2. You may have NO MORE THAN 4 ships per hex, (Max of 4 ships per hex. Only applies to ships, does NOT apply to ammunition).
    <br>So this means that if you have 4 ships in a hex, and all of them fire at the enemy, you will only be able to 'reload' 2 of the ships.
        So next round, the 2 you did not reload will not be able to fire at the enemy.
    <br>Both rules are enforced by the game engine.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>RULES:</b>
    <br><b>1)</b> You can Place up to 2 new shells per turn PER HEX (any and all hex), so you may wish to keep your units spread out.
    <br><b>2)</b> You may have NO MORE THAN 4 ships per hex, (max of 4 ships per hex).
    <br><b>3)</b> You can ONLY attack submarines with Depth Charges.
    <br><b>4)</b> Only Submarines may carry Torpedos, and Torpedos may not travel through targets to get to a further target (Torpedos hit the first target in their
        path, while shells can fly over targets to reach further targets).
    <br><b>5)</b> Battleships have 2 hit points, but do <b>NOT repair</b>.  All other ships have 1 hit point.
    <br>
    <br><b>AMMUNITION UNIT STATS:</b>
    <br>Battleship_Shell (big) = 4 attack / 4 movement max to a target (used by both battlecruisers and battleships)
    <br>Cruiser_Shell (medium) = 3 attack / 3 movement max to a target
    <br>Destroyer_Shell (small) = 2 attack / 2 movement max to a target
    <br>Torpedo = 4 attack / 2 movement max to a target
    <br>Depth_Charge = 4 attack / 1 movement max to a target
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>TIPS:</b>
    <br><b>*</b> To switch between a Shell and a Depth Charge, just fire your shell/charge into the ocean during the combat-move phase, then place the new
        shell/charge onto the ship during the placement phase.
    <br><b>*</b> You may Attack a sea hex with as many shells/charges/torpedoes as you want, (The stack limit is only on "Placing", which is basically just "reloading").
    <br><b>*</b> Ramming into ships is pointless, your ramming ship will die and not do any damage to the rammed ship (This is intentional).
    <br><b>*</b> Cruisers and Battlecruisers are the most effective means of hunting subs.  Destroyers can not carry Depth Charges (in ww1 destroyers were
        anti-tboat units, not anti-sub units, destroyers did not become anti-sub units until ww2).
    <br><b>*</b> You get +1 movement when moving away from your factory / naval base.
    <br><b>*</b> To see the big picture, try using "Map Zoom" from the View menu at the top of the screen.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Use of Edit Mode (not necessary):
    <br>You do not need to use edit mode to play. You can follow all the rules and never have to use edit mode once.
    <br>
    <br>* To move subborn ships with the correct shells attached.  Example: sometimes when you have multiple ship types and multiple shell types in the same hex, and you try to
        move a ship, the game grabs the wrong shell to go with it.  If this happens, undo and try again moving just 1 ship at a time.  If this still does not work, use
        edit mode's movement feature to move what you want where it is allowed to go.  (To do this, go into edit mode, then click the action tab on the right by
        the stats tab, then edit mode will allow you to move units).  This is very rare, as moving ships 1 at a time solves the problem most of the time.
    <br>
    <br>* To switch from a Shell to a Depth Charge, or from a Depth Charge to a Shell.  The preferred method is to fire your shells/charges into the ocean and let
        them die, then place a new shell/depth charge on the ship during the placement phase (therefore it is not needed to use edit mode).
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Detailed Unit Stats:
    <br>2 movement: Battleships (bb) have 12 capacity.
    <br>3 movement: Battlecruisers (bc) have 12 capacity.
    <br>2 movement: Cruisers (cc) have 7 capacity.
    <br>1 movement: Submarines (ss) have 5 capacity.
    <br>3 movement: Destroyers (dd) have 3 capacity.
    <br>
    <br>bb_shell takes up 12 capacity.
    <br>cc_shell takes up 6 capacity.
    <br>depth charge takes up 7 capacity (only thing that can attack subs).
    <br>torpedo takes up 5 capacity.
    <br>dd_shell takes up 3 capacity.

      <br>The map expands the ideas of the board game with: Cavalry, Ships, Objectives and Alliances.
      <br>Each clan starts with only his captial and claims more and more territories from his foe.
      <br>After a few rounds of easy expanding into passive minor Clan territories, the real fight for domination starts.
      <br>Each Clan fights for its own and most of them will be controlled by the AI to make it lively and every game unique.
      <br>The AI gets many useful boni (all optional) and is challenging for a single player match, too.

    <br>Includes 3 variants of New World Order
    <br>
    <br>1) NWO by Smallman.
    <br>Map is designed to promote the faster units resulting in less stagnant stacks, and increased variety each game.
    <br>Changes: Infantry, Transports, Submarines cost 1 more, Elites and Artillery 0.5 more, Mech.Inf and Katyusha cost 1 less.
    <br>Finnland has 2 more EarlyFighters, Stalingrad 5 more Armour, and Paris has 1 more Bunker.
    <br>
    <br>2) NWO 5 Nation
    <br>Same units as normal NWO, but with slightly changed territory values and only 5 nations: Germany and Italy against Russia, the UK, and USA.
    <br>
    <br>3) NWO Eastern Front by Penguins
    <br>Fewer nations and fewer units than regular NWO, and the territories that were neutral in World War 2 are now impassible.
    <br>
    <br>You must have TripleA 1.5.x.x or later installed in order to use these game variants, as only triplea 1.5 or later come with "new_world_order" and the needed unit images.

    <br>1. adoy's version of PoS with China added.
    <br>   This is a variation of Pact of Steel. China has been made its own seperate power, and it has been attempted to rebalance the game accordingly. Their capital is on
        Sinkiang. Sinkiang is now a Victory City and is worth 3 PU's. Central United States is now worth 5 PU's. China goes after Japan and before the United States. Enjoy!
    <br>
    <br>2. Pact of Steel China Added game with WWII v3 rules.
    <br>   This mod uses the Pact of Steel map with the new rule structure from World War II v3 and China as an additional Ally.  Original POS by: Black Elk, Madmat, Beagle and
            Cousin Joe POS China Added by: Adoya http://adoyaaa.blogspot.com WWIIv3 Rules update by SirAdamTheGreat Last edited Dec29, 2009.

    <br>About the mods:
    <br>
    <br>   Hoshi Head: The Chinese and an Italian player were added to old WW-2-Revised map.
    <br>
    <br>   additional changes to Hoshi Head version:
    <br>   - WW2v3 rules were added.
    <br>   - all have paratroopers from the beginning on (how can that be a new technology?).
    <br>   - Western Russia and Belorussia will be Russian after freed by any allies (because both belong to Russia and cannot be British or American).
    <br>   - some territory's PU's were changed due to historical reasons.
    <br>   Belorus: from 2 to 1 (what is there but villages and Minsk..?)
    <br>   Archangelsk: from 2 to 1 (nothing but cold temperatures)
    <br>   Borneo and East Indies: from 4 to 3 (Borneo cannot bring in more than India)
    <br>   Novosibirsk: from 2 to 3 (very important industry region during WW2)
    <br>   As a result, German starting PU's decreased from 30 to 29 and Japanese from 30 to 28.

    <br>v3 Variants of World At War (original map by Sieg)
    <br>Version 1.7.5, last update 2017.03.16 for engine 1.9.0.0
    <br>Mod done by sneakingcoward.
    <br>Suggestions to wgbt@gmx.at
    <br>Game is continuously played by PBEM. Gamers state, that it is one of the best games listed at the depot.
    <br>
    <br>a.) Content:
    <br>Includes 3 Mods of WAW.
    <br>World at War Variant - v3 ... (with Japan as 2 parties Yamamoto and Hisaichi)
    <br>World at War Variant - FUEL-AA-Range ... (with Japanese as only 1 combined party)
    <br>World at War Variant - vXXX ... (with Japanese as only 1 combined party)
    <br>
    <br>b.) Rough overview:
    <br>Detailed description inside game notes, following is a rough overview.
    <br>
    <br>All Variants use v3 rules and include:
    <br>- paratroopers
    <br>- air+sea+land transports, also landing boats, generally proper transport concept
    <br>- construction unit
    <br>- ability to destroy structures with strategic bombing raid (SBR)
    <br>- destroy structures at a retreat
    <br>- fighter escorting+intercepting and air battle before normal battle
    <br>- battle rounds limit
    <br>- multiple hitPoints
    <br>- Turn order, which combines axis+allies parties and is therefore perfect for PBEM.
    <br>
    <br>The FUEL-AA-Range mod uses additional:
    <br>- "Change unit owners" from Brit&US to Rus&CN and Rus to CN
    <br>- Fighter scrambling with radar
    <br>- Fighter can also do SBR to train, radar, construction and not intercepted planes
    <br>- Fuel consumption for production+movement, incl. refineries
    <br>- AntiAir (AA) separated to combat- (hit 1 of 6) and bombing raid- (hit 1 of 12) AA
    <br>- Airbase enables full range for planes
    <br>
    <br>The vXXX mod uses additional:
    <br>- Recruits
    <br>- SBR of ships
    <br>- Slightly modified setup for this variant
    <br>
    <br>c.) General tips:
    <br>Due to the wide range of possibilities its more a game for experienced players (typical rounds 30).
    <br>Specially the supply strategy is crucial for this mod with air+sea+land transport units.
    <br>The combination of all possible features enables almost a real handling of warfare.
    <br>The fuel mod opens a totally new strategy setup. Big unit groups can't move forever, so use your fuel wisely.

    <br>The year is 2010.

    <br>The nations of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) have moved their troops towards the borders with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
    <br>
    <br>A minor conflict between their respective allies, the Peace and Security Council (PSC) of the African Union and the Union of South American Nations (USAN), will set the
        world on fire...
    <br>
    <br>Map designed and created by: Bas71.
    <br>
    <br>About this map:
    <br>
    <br>* This map is based on the WW2V3 ruleset and units.
    <br>* The alliance organizations in this map, are actual alliances.
    <br>* The production-value per territory is based on the actual GDP, the natural resources, and the size and growth of their populations.
    <br>* The starting units are based on the actual military strength of each territory.
    <br>* Neutral territories are powerful, yet interesting to conquer due to their strategic positions and/or production-values.

    <br>Cold War Asia (1948) covers three interconnected civil wars between pro-democracy and pro-communist forces following the end of WWII, circa 1947 to 1948 and extending past the 1950 Chinese Revolution, the Korean War, and the First Indochina War. Victory Condition... An alliance occupies 10 of the 11 Victory Cities.
    <br>
    <br>A second alternate history variant adds a hypothetical where the US did not drop nuclear weapons on Japan in 1945 and Japan was occupied by the US and USSR following WWII. This variant covers four interconnected civil wars, the three mentioned above plus an alternative history Japan civil war. Victory Condition... An alliance occupies 15 of the 16 Victory Cities.

    <br>On 29 November 1947 the United Nations General Assembly approved a plan to resolve the Arab-Jewish conflict by
        partitioning Palestine into two states, one Jewish and one Arab. After the Arab rejection of this plan, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon
        and Syria invaded the territory of the former British Mandate of Palestine. The war concluded with the 1949 Armistice Agreements, but it
        did not mark the end of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Three more wars would follow.
    <br>
    <br>The Camp David map consists of the four Arab - Israeli wars:
    <br>
    <br>* 1948 Arab-Israeli War
    <br>* 1956 Suez Crisis
    <br>* 1967 Six-Day War
    <br>* 1973 Yom Kippur War

    <br>October 1962: Cuban Missle Crisis
    <br>
    <br>Instead of following demands by the U.S. to remove missles in Cuba, Cuba is alligned with the United Soviet Socialist Republics(USSR) to not follow those orders,
        which then leads to war between the North Atlantic Trade Organisation(NATO) members and the Warsaw-Pact members including Cuba.

    <br>The Great Northern War (1700-21) ended the Swedish Empire, leaving Russia dominant in the Baltic Sea and a major
        player in European politics. The war began as a coordinated attack on Sweden by the coalition in 1700 and ended
        in 1721 with the Treaty of Nystad and the Stockholm treaties. It was fought between a coalition of Russia, Denmark-Norway,
        and Saxony (also the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from 1701 and Prussia and Hanover from 1715) and many smaller
        northgerman states on one side and Sweden, which was partially helped by the Ottoman Empire (who later left the war) on the other.

    <br>
    <br>b.) Rough overview:
    <br>A strategic-level Civil War scenario adapted from a simple-yet-elegant
    <br>board game. Two players face off as the North and the South in the
    <br>American Civil War of 1861-65. Each has control of infantry and
    <br>cavalry units, which can be upgraded to stronger versions after
    <br>winning battles. Three generals -- Lee, Grant, and Sherman -- are also
    <br>featured. Players fight for control of territory with very different
    <br>victory objectives.
    <br>
    <br>Much of the game is about maneuvering, as better position can trump
    <br>superior firepower, and things evolve in surprising ways. A system for
    <br>rail and river movement really mixes things up, and cavalry can jump
    <br>over defenders to wreak havoc behind enemy lines.
    <br>
    <br>The North has lots of advantages, but the South has more ways to win,
    <br>giving each side a distinct flavor.
    <br>
    <br>c) General tips:
    <br>AI play is not possible; human-vs.-human play only, online or via email.

    <br>If you are a fan of Star Control you will quickly notice this map is made with love from a fanboi. You will see every ship featured in Star Control 2, including the ones only available in super melee like the Androsynth Guardian. This map does play differently than most space maps however in that every tile is a land tile and all ships are considered land units(except 2 air units). This may seem odd but is mostly canonical since in Star Control 2 you knew a system was owned by a specific race because they had ships in the system, not because of soldiers on the planets.
    <br>
    <br>The game features
    <br>- 15 major factions and 3 minor factions available
    <br>- 218 tiles(one for each solar system featured in Star Control 2's galaxy map)
    <br>- and 34 units including special one time use ships like the Sa-Matra
    <br>
    <br>c.) General tips:

    <br>Each lord can recruit sworn troops, mercenaries, druids, and ships to his cause, taking over castles and towns via title or conquest.
    <br>Three sacred relics must be gathered to a player's faction to anoint one of its nobles as the new king.

    <br>Empire is a free-for-all strategy game set in the late Roman Empire as various caesars take the field to win dominance. Inspired by a once-popular board game.
    <br>Each caesar starts off in one of six provinces of the empire with a small army and a fortified city.
    <br>Using his limited supply of generals to lead his troops, each expands and tries to outdo and eliminate the competition - conquer a rival caesar, and you get all his territory and troops as well.
    <br>Along the way, build and fortify cities, send war galleys across the Mediterranean, ransom or execute captive generals, and cope with rampant inflation as the cost of war doubles and triples.

    <p><b>Welcome to the world of dead reptiles and avian ancestors.</b></p>
    <p><br>The map is a low resolution image produced from NASA topological data.</p>
    <br>The globe was rotated to center Iceland on the equator before slicing it open and laying it flat.
    <br>This reduces distortions for all land, since only water remains at the poles.
    <br>A small section of turf around Greenland is used for JURASSIC.  Greenland's massive ice block makes it the perfect volcano for the Dimorphodon, one of the first Pterosaurs.
    <br>This location is impassable and the capital of Tithonia.
    <br>The players are named after the eleven periods of the Jurassic era.
    <br>Their positions on the board make game play more or less difficult.
    <br>This is reflected in the player list order with easiest on the bottom.
    <br>The top player is unique with a special dinosaur; Dimorphodon.
    <br>All other players have a full list of other dinosaurs from the Jurassic Period.
    <br>The first player is meant to be a nuisance; a leftover from the Triassic.
    <br>Even though the capital is impassable, you can still create but cannot return; like deamons emerging from the pit of Hell.
    <br>
    <br>The map is colored for topologic elevation and not actual vegetation conditions. Sea level after the last Ice Age, ten-thousand years ago, was nearly 400-feet lower than today.
    <br>This is easy to see as the continental shelves (light blue areas). Sadly, all that topology has been washed clean.
    <br>Territory Effects are employed to allow land reptiles to swim, and ocean dwellers to flop around on land.
    <br>Study the Effects chart in the NOTES, or snap a screen shot and place it on your desktop for reference.
    <br>Territories are labeled with a Terrain Tag. Combat is based on 12-sided dice.
    <br>All creatures looking right are defense oriented.
    <br>Each dinosaur has advantages, and the project purpose is to bring dinosaurs into the Triple-A family.

    <br>A VERY simple map.
    <br>Purpose: use these files to make your first map.  If you can make a map out of it, then you can do anything.
    <br>Basically, many people try to make these big elaborate maps as their very first map, and it often does not turn out well.  They get frustrated, have tons of bugs, and
        can't get the game to work (my very first map did not run either...).
    <br>So the idea here is that you can take all these files, run them through the map creator, and in 20 minutes you will have a working map.  If you can make it work without bugs,
        and it runs, then you better understand the development process for maps and go apply what you learned here to the map you always wanted to make.
