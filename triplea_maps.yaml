# This file is read live by the game whenever you click 'download maps'. Updating this file on the
# github server will have immediate effect on all game installations. Be careful to not break old
# game engine versions when adding new fields (but note, unrecognized yaml field names are simply ignored)
#
#
# Map Property Descriptions:
#
# mapName: This is the name of your map as it would be presented on the map download screen
#        NOTE: there is a constraint on your map name and repo name. When your map name is converted
#              to all lower case, and spaces replaced with underscore, it must match the repository name.
#        IE, for:  https://github.com/triplea-maps/hex_globe10/archive/master.zip
#               The map name may be: "Hex Globe10", or "Hex_Glob10"
#               But the map name may NOT be: "HexGlobe10", or "Hex Globe 10"
#
# url: This is the location where a map zip can be downloaded. This should be a location on github and
#      should be pretty similar to any of the other map download URLs
#
# version: The map download version, used by the game to determine if an existing map is out of date.
#          The game engine uses the map version number found in XML for any other usages (yeah, that is confusing.)
#          Just know that this is *only* used by the download screen for determining if a map is out of date.
#          The game keeps track of the current map version downloaded in the extra .properties file that is created
#          in addition to every map file downloaded
#
# description: HTMl description of the map. This description appears in the map download window. The map title
#         and image are printed automatically and do not need to be included in the description
#

    <br>
    <br>The empires of Europe are at war.
    <br>The upstart French Republic has followed in the footsteps of their American compatriots across the sea and cast off the trappings of monarchy.
    <br>Can this new light in Europe survive against a host of squabbling adversaries?
    <br>Or will it fall victim to its own aspirations for an empire...
    <br>Will the Russians be forced to sing La Marseillaise?
    <br>Will the English see the Guillotine raised in Piccadilly?
    <br>Or will the rule of the monarchs be ensured by the restoration of Louis XVIII to the Parisian throne?

    <b><em>December 1941</em></b>
    <br>
    <b>The brutal winter conditions have stalled all actions of the rampaging Wehrmacht just short of Moscow.
    <br>Stalin has organized Russian elite troops from Siberia in preparation for a massive counterattack.
    <br>Japan is determined to rule the Pacific and gain access to the resources needed by force.
    <br>The Imperial Fleet has maneuvered undetected and is now in position to attack Pearl Harbor.
    <br>Roosevelt eager to enter the war for the Allies, will get his Casus Belli at the cost of thousands of American sailors lives.
    <br>China is fighting for its very survival in desperate hopes of repelling the Japanese occupation of its homeland.
    <br>Italy is determined to restore a Romanesque dominion in the Mediterranean Sea and Africa, while British forces struggle to try
    <br>to hold on to their territories across the globe.
    <br>The events in December 1941 turn the scattered regional conflicts into a Total World War for the 2nd time.</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>There is a detailed manual included within the map zip. If you do not know how to get to it, you can download it here:

    <br><b>Minor Nations (those in brackets like Finland) have their own territories which generate income and production, but their forces are transferred, controlled and moved by their associated Major power (Germany).</b>
    <br><b>This creates a unique gameplay experience where the Major powers have limited ability to exploit production capacity in far flung regions that were underdeveloped and were limited to the use of their own local resources.</b>

    <br>Important!!! Requires TripleA pre-release above 1.9.0.0.11000 to function properly!
    <br>Watch trailer: https://youtu.be/iucvX0wSO30
    <br>
    <br>Black clouds are gathering over Mordor. The mightiest realms of the Third Age stand prepared for yet another war, to forever seal the fate of Arda... Will the Shadow once again cover Middle Earth - or will the forces of Good heal it of what Evil had wrought? Lead the forces of Good or Evil to victory in this epic conflict, the Battle for Arda!
    <br>
    <br>The game takes place in a slightly altered timeline (includes realms that never coexisted).
    <br>Middle Earth: Battle for Arda features a vast map with hundreds of territories and sixteen factions, each of which coming with unique unit sets. The great variety in unit abilities and the interconnectedness of the theaters leaves a lot of room for exploration in strategy.
    <br>
    <br>Game design by alkexr. Visual style by Hepps. Contributions by Frostion and redrum. Thanks for the members of the TripleA community for their feedback and ideas, who enabled turning this into a truly great map.
    <br>This map is the continuation of the (deprecated) Large Middle Earth map. Currently in balance testing period.

    <br>An adaptation of the game "Diplomacy" for TripleA.
    <br>Includes 3 Free-For-All (ffa) games, and 1 normal
    <br>
    <br>1) Diplomacy
    <br>This is as close as TripleA lets us come to the real Diplomacy board game. Uses some complex rules, be sure to read the game notes.
    <br>
    <br>2) Diplomacy: FFA V3 Rules
    <br>This is the Diplomacy map of Europe, with ww2v3 units and rules.  Easy to learn.
    <br>
    <br>3) Diplomacy: FFA Great War Style
    <br>This is the Diplomacy map of Europe, with "Great War" units.  Also very easy to learn.
    <br>
    <br>4) Diplomacy: WW1
    <br>Unlike the other 3, this is a normal non-ffa game.  It pits Germany, Austria, and Turkey, against France, England, and Russia.  (Italy is neutral)
        It uses Diplomacy style units, Armies and Navies, with 3 territory types: Land, Sea, and Coastal.
    <br>

    <br>This is an 18 player FFA map with all players neutral to each other at the start.  Players can change their political
    <br>stance toward other nations, from neutral to cooperative, friendly, aligned and allied or to uncooperative,
    <br>unfriendly, hostile, and permanent war.  Every nation starts with the same units but a different geographic
    <br>in a completely custom world.
    <br>
    <br>Grow your population, build cities and factories, expand militarily, and use diplomacy to advance your
    <br>nation to supremacy.  Develop nuclear capabilities, control the seas, and use canals to out-maneuver your
    <br>enemies.  Units fight and move differently depending on terrain.  Use generals and admirals.
    <br>Neutral units control most of the land at the start, some are very difficult to defeat.
    <br>In addition to resources from gaining territory, use merchant ships to gain income from trade.

    <br>a.) Content:
    <br>Includes 2 scenarios of Big World 2
    <br>Big World 2 : Balance of Power
    <br>Big World 2 : Rise of the Axis
    <br>
    <br>b.) Rough overview:
    <br>This is a World War 2 themed global map like ww2v3, ww2 revised, Big World 1942 and TWW. This is an averaged sized map. The game play is slower than ww2v3 and ww2 revised, but far faster than NWO and TWW. The game can be decided as quickly as round 6 (approximately 3 hours) but could sometimes drag on to rounds 10+ between experienced players.
    <br>
    <br>Features common in both scenarios
    <br>- give players a choice of v3 style or NWO/revised style transport and submarine rules.
    <br>- automatically balances starting position under either v3 style or revised rules
    <br>- optional national objectives for extra income
    <br>- optional national advantages for unique units or abilities
    <br>- optional balanced techs. Each tech is more-or-less balanced so that no single tech is overpowered.
    <br>- been in development since 2011, playtested over 4 years for balance.
    <br>
    <br>Big World 2 : Balance of Power
    <br>This map develops from Big World : 1942 v3 rules by Prussia, Veqryn, Bung, Pulicat et al. The scenario is set at the turning point of WW2 with the battles of Stalingrad and Midway imminent. Experienced players on Big World : 1942 or its variants should have very little problem playing this map. Playable nations are Russia, Germany, Britain, Italy, China, Japan and USA.
    <br>
    <br>Big World 2: Rise of the Axis
    <br>This is a 1939 scenario. One Unique feature is the inclusion of the French, who are likely to survive until at least the second round. It is more cost-efficient for Germany to capture Poland before France. Other historical events such as Germany's Axis alliance, Vichy France Surrender and Pearl Harbor are also depicted. This map offers a great variety of strategies for the Axis.

    <br> <b><em>by Veqryn</em></b>
    <br>
    <br>May 31, 1916, the two greatest navies in the world set sail to meet in the greatest and only full-scale clash of battleships in history.
    <br>The German High Seas Fleet planned to use its scouting battlecruisers to draw the Royal Navy's battlecruiser group of the Grand Fleet into a trap and
        destroy it before the rest of the Grand Fleet could arrive.  The Royal Navy sought to cut the germans off from their port, then use their numerical
        advantage to annihilate the Germans.
    <br>
    <br><b>TO WIN:</b>
    <br>Move an Admiral (your flag) into the enemy's capital.
    <br>You can do this by defeating your enemy's navy, or by sneaking around it with a fast task force.
    <br>Conquer the convoy zones to slowly turn the tide against your enemy (most worth 10 PUs each, some worth 20 PUs).
    <br>
    <br><b>HOW TO PLAY:</b>
    <br>This is a tactical game, which means each piece represents a single ship, instead of a navy.
    <br>Each nation is broken up into 2 players: Movement and Armament (Attack).
    <br>The Movement player first moves all of that nations ships around, as well as buying and placing any new ships, Then the Attack player moves
        the Shells, Torpedos, and Depth Charges to attack the enemy ships.  The Attack player is simulating the ships firing their weapons at the enemy.
    <br>The armament (ammunition) used to attack the enemy is used up in the first round of battle and 'dies'.
    <br>Then, the Armament player then simulates the ships reloading their weapons, by placing new ammunition on each ship.
    <br>
    <br>In order to make this a tactical game, we need to give players a good reason to spread out their fleets.
        Here are 2 very good reasons to spread out your ships:
    <br>1. You can only Reload (Place) up to 2 new shells/ammunition per turn PER HEX (any, every, and all hexes).
    <br>2. You may have NO MORE THAN 4 ships per hex, (Max of 4 ships per hex. Only applies to ships, does NOT apply to ammunition).
    <br>So this means that if you have 4 ships in a hex, and all of them fire at the enemy, you will only be able to 'reload' 2 of the ships.
        So next round, the 2 you did not reload will not be able to fire at the enemy.
    <br>Both rules are enforced by the game engine.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>RULES:</b>
    <br><b>1)</b> You can Place up to 2 new shells per turn PER HEX (any and all hex), so you may wish to keep your units spread out.
    <br><b>2)</b> You may have NO MORE THAN 4 ships per hex, (max of 4 ships per hex).
    <br><b>3)</b> You can ONLY attack submarines with Depth Charges.
    <br><b>4)</b> Only Submarines may carry Torpedos, and Torpedos may not travel through targets to get to a further target (Torpedos hit the first target in their
        path, while shells can fly over targets to reach further targets).
    <br><b>5)</b> Battleships have 2 hit points, but do <b>NOT repair</b>.  All other ships have 1 hit point.
    <br>
    <br><b>AMMUNITION UNIT STATS:</b>
    <br>Battleship_Shell (big) = 4 attack / 4 movement max to a target (used by both battlecruisers and battleships)
    <br>Cruiser_Shell (medium) = 3 attack / 3 movement max to a target
    <br>Destroyer_Shell (small) = 2 attack / 2 movement max to a target
    <br>Torpedo = 4 attack / 2 movement max to a target
    <br>Depth_Charge = 4 attack / 1 movement max to a target
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>TIPS:</b>
    <br><b>*</b> To switch between a Shell and a Depth Charge, just fire your shell/charge into the ocean during the combat-move phase, then place the new
        shell/charge onto the ship during the placement phase.
    <br><b>*</b> You may Attack a sea hex with as many shells/charges/torpedoes as you want, (The stack limit is only on "Placing", which is basically just "reloading").
    <br><b>*</b> Ramming into ships is pointless, your ramming ship will die and not do any damage to the rammed ship (This is intentional).
    <br><b>*</b> Cruisers and Battlecruisers are the most effective means of hunting subs.  Destroyers can not carry Depth Charges (in ww1 destroyers were
        anti-tboat units, not anti-sub units, destroyers did not become anti-sub units until ww2).
    <br><b>*</b> You get +1 movement when moving away from your factory / naval base.
    <br><b>*</b> To see the big picture, try using "Map Zoom" from the View menu at the top of the screen.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Use of Edit Mode (not necessary):
    <br>You do not need to use edit mode to play. You can follow all the rules and never have to use edit mode once.
    <br>
    <br>* To move subborn ships with the correct shells attached.  Example: sometimes when you have multiple ship types and multiple shell types in the same hex, and you try to
        move a ship, the game grabs the wrong shell to go with it.  If this happens, undo and try again moving just 1 ship at a time.  If this still does not work, use
        edit mode's movement feature to move what you want where it is allowed to go.  (To do this, go into edit mode, then click the action tab on the right by
        the stats tab, then edit mode will allow you to move units).  This is very rare, as moving ships 1 at a time solves the problem most of the time.
    <br>
    <br>* To switch from a Shell to a Depth Charge, or from a Depth Charge to a Shell.  The preferred method is to fire your shells/charges into the ocean and let
        them die, then place a new shell/depth charge on the ship during the placement phase (therefore it is not needed to use edit mode).
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>Detailed Unit Stats:
    <br>2 movement: Battleships (bb) have 12 capacity.
    <br>3 movement: Battlecruisers (bc) have 12 capacity.
    <br>2 movement: Cruisers (cc) have 7 capacity.
    <br>1 movement: Submarines (ss) have 5 capacity.
    <br>3 movement: Destroyers (dd) have 3 capacity.
    <br>
    <br>bb_shell takes up 12 capacity.
    <br>cc_shell takes up 6 capacity.
    <br>depth charge takes up 7 capacity (only thing that can attack subs).
    <br>torpedo takes up 5 capacity.
    <br>dd_shell takes up 3 capacity.

    <br>But, even without all the cards that come with the game, it stands alone just fine as a good game by it's own right."

    <br>EB: "I am taking a risk here, putting it in the main section right away, since I did not test this mod. But it is so awesomely well done, looking great, perfect documentation,

    <br>
    <br>On 29 November 1947 the United Nations General Assembly approved a plan to resolve the Arab-Jewish conflict by
        partitioning Palestine into two states, one Jewish and one Arab. After the Arab rejection of this plan, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon
        and Syria invaded the territory of the former British Mandate of Palestine. The war concluded with the 1949 Armistice Agreements, but it
        did not mark the end of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Three more wars would follow.
    <br>
    <br>The Camp David map consists of the four Arab - Israeli wars:
    <br>
    <br>* 1948 Arab-Israeli War
    <br>* 1956 Suez Crisis
    <br>* 1967 Six-Day War
    <br>* 1973 Yom Kippur War

    <br>
    <br>1. June 1942, by Prussia, with a focus on implementing the new technology from v3, as well as national objectives, and new units.
    <br>
    <br>2. Small's 1939, by Smallman, has many neutrals to consider taking over for extra income. Mod balanced for dice and ll, with good strategy variety.
        Has been around for years and balanced tested over 100 times, was edited from Nekahnets original 1939 version.
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>Includes 3 variants of New World Order
    <br>
    <br>1) NWO by Smallman.
    <br>Map is designed to promote the faster units resulting in less stagnant stacks, and increased variety each game.
    <br>Changes: Infantry, Transports, Submarines cost 1 more, Elites and Artillery 0.5 more, Mech.Inf and Katyusha cost 1 less.
    <br>Finnland has 2 more EarlyFighters, Stalingrad 5 more Armour, and Paris has 1 more Bunker.
    <br>
    <br>2) NWO 5 Nation
    <br>Same units as normal NWO, but with slightly changed territory values and only 5 nations: Germany and Italy against Russia, the UK, and USA.
    <br>
    <br>3) NWO Eastern Front by Penguins
    <br>Fewer nations and fewer units than regular NWO, and the territories that were neutral in World War 2 are now impassible.
    <br>
    <br>You must have TripleA 1.5.x.x or later installed in order to use these game variants, as only triplea 1.5 or later come with "new_world_order" and the needed unit images.

    <br>1. adoy's version of PoS with China added.
    <br>   This is a variation of Pact of Steel. China has been made its own seperate power, and it has been attempted to rebalance the game accordingly. Their capital is on
        Sinkiang. Sinkiang is now a Victory City and is worth 3 PU's. Central United States is now worth 5 PU's. China goes after Japan and before the United States. Enjoy!
    <br>
    <br>2. Pact of Steel China Added game with WWII v3 rules.
    <br>   This mod uses the Pact of Steel map with the new rule structure from World War II v3 and China as an additional Ally.  Original POS by: Black Elk, Madmat, Beagle and
            Cousin Joe POS China Added by: Adoya http://adoyaaa.blogspot.com WWIIv3 Rules update by SirAdamTheGreat Last edited Dec29, 2009.

    <br>
    <br>About the mods:
    <br>
    <br>   Hoshi Head: The Chinese and an Italian player were added to old WW-2-Revised map.
    <br>
    <br>   additional changes to Hoshi Head version:
    <br>   - WW2v3 rules were added.
    <br>   - all have paratroopers from the beginning on (how can that be a new technology?).
    <br>   - Western Russia and Belorussia will be Russian after freed by any allies (because both belong to Russia and cannot be British or American).
    <br>   - some territory's PU's were changed due to historical reasons.
    <br>   Belorus: from 2 to 1 (what is there but villages and Minsk..?)
    <br>   Archangelsk: from 2 to 1 (nothing but cold temperatures)
    <br>   Borneo and East Indies: from 4 to 3 (Borneo cannot bring in more than India)
    <br>   Novosibirsk: from 2 to 3 (very important industry region during WW2)
    <br>   As a result, German starting PU's decreased from 30 to 29 and Japanese from 30 to 28.

    <br>v3 Variants of World At War (original map by Sieg)
    <br>Version 1.8.0, last update 2020.03.30 for engine 1.9.0.0
    <br>Mod done by sneakingcoward.
    <br>Suggestions to wgbt@gmx.at
    <br>Game is continuously played by PBEM. Gamers state, that it is one of the best games listed at the depot.
    <br>
    <br>a.) Content:
    <br>Includes 3 Mods of WAW.
    <br>World at War Variant - v3 ... (with Japan as 2 parties Yamamoto and Hisaichi)
    <br>World at War Variant - FUEL-AA-Range ... (with Japanese as only 1 combined party)
    <br>World at War Variant - vXXX ... (with Japanese as only 1 combined party)
    <br>
    <br>b.) Rough overview:
    <br>Detailed description inside game notes, following is a rough overview.
    <br>
    <br>All Variants use v3 rules and include:
    <br>- paratroopers
    <br>- air+sea+land transports, also landing boats, generally proper transport concept
    <br>- construction unit
    <br>- ability to destroy structures with strategic bombing raid (SBR)
    <br>- destroy structures at a retreat
    <br>- fighter escorting+intercepting and air battle before normal battle
    <br>- battle rounds limit
    <br>- multiple hitPoints
    <br>- Turn order, which combines axis+allies parties and is therefore perfect for PBEM.
    <br>
    <br>The FUEL-AA-Range mod uses additional:
    <br>- "Change unit owners" from Brit&US to Rus&CN and Rus to CN
    <br>- Fighter scrambling with radar
    <br>- Fighter can also do SBR to train, radar, construction and not intercepted planes
    <br>- Fuel consumption for production+movement, incl. refineries
    <br>- AntiAir (AA) separated to combat- (hit 1 of 6) and bombing raid- (hit 1 of 12) AA
    <br>- Airbase enables full range for planes
    <br>
    <br>The vXXX mod uses additional:
    <br>- Recruits
    <br>- Slightly modified setup for this variant
    <br>- Ships SBR
    <br>- Land units SBR
    <br>
    <br>c.) General tips:
    <br>Due to the wide range of possibilities its more a game for experienced players (typical rounds 30).
    <br>Specially the supply strategy is crucial for this mod with air+sea+land transport units.
    <br>The combination of all possible features enables almost a real handling of warfare.
    <br>The fuel mod opens a totally new strategy setup. Big unit groups can't move forever, so use your fuel wisely.

    <br>  A mod of WWIIv3 1941 where all the main players start the game with one or two active technologies and 6 free tech tokens, to roll on round 1. During the course of the game, additional free tech tokens are received and rolled, representing the technological development inherent in the system. The new tech chart offers 4 categories with 3 technologies each. Newly developed technologies activate during placement. The Heavy Bombers technological advancement is restricted to bombing raids only, for 2 dice damage per bomber.
    <br>  All the default changes are options enabled as default: you can customise this game back to standard WWIIv3 rules and add whatever of the options you wish, on top of it.

    <br>The Cold War... a period of great uncertainty. The 1960s saw the Berlin Wall go up, the Cuban Missile Crisis,
    <br>the Sino-Soviet split, the Vietnam War, the Six Days War, the continued stand-off between the Koreas, tension between India and Pakistan,
    <br>the end of European Colonialism (and the collapse of many successor states), and of course, the proliferation of nuclear arms.
    <br>This was a tense period in our history, in which any number of small conflicts could have escalated quickly into WWIII.

    <br>The Great Northern War (1700-21) ended the Swedish Empire, leaving Russia dominant in the Baltic Sea and a major
        player in European politics. The war began as a coordinated attack on Sweden by the coalition in 1700 and ended
        in 1721 with the Treaty of Nystad and the Stockholm treaties. It was fought between a coalition of Russia, Denmark-Norway,
        and Saxony (also the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from 1701 and Prussia and Hanover from 1715) and many smaller
        northgerman states on one side and Sweden, which was partially helped by the Ottoman Empire (who later left the war) on the other.

    <br>b.) Rough overview:
    <br>A strategic-level Civil War scenario adapted from a simple-yet-elegant
    <br>board game. Two players face off as the North and the South in the
    <br>American Civil War of 1861-65. Each has control of infantry and
    <br>cavalry units, which can be upgraded to stronger versions after
    <br>winning battles. Three generals -- Lee, Grant, and Sherman -- are also
    <br>featured. Players fight for control of territory with very different
    <br>victory objectives.
    <br>
    <br>Much of the game is about maneuvering, as better position can trump
    <br>superior firepower, and things evolve in surprising ways. A system for
    <br>rail and river movement really mixes things up, and cavalry can jump
    <br>over defenders to wreak havoc behind enemy lines.
    <br>
    <br>The North has lots of advantages, but the South has more ways to win,
    <br>giving each side a distinct flavor.
    <br>

    <br>AI play is not possible; human-vs.-human play only, online or via email.

    <br>If you are a fan of Star Control you will quickly notice this map is made with love from a fanboi. You will see every ship featured in Star Control 2, including the ones only available in super melee like the Androsynth Guardian. This map does play differently than most space maps however in that every tile is a land tile and all ships are considered land units(except 2 air units). This may seem odd but is mostly canonical since in Star Control 2 you knew a system was owned by a specific race because they had ships in the system, not because of soldiers on the planets.
    <br>
    <br>The game features
    <br>- 15 major factions and 3 minor factions available
    <br>- 218 tiles(one for each solar system featured in Star Control 2's galaxy map)
    <br>- and 34 units including special one time use ships like the Sa-Matra
    <br>
    <br>c.) General tips:

    <br>Each lord can recruit sworn troops, mercenaries, druids, and ships to his cause, taking over castles and towns via title or conquest.
    <br>Three sacred relics must be gathered to a player's faction to anoint one of its nobles as the new king.
    <br>A system of random events can thwart the best-laid plans at the most inconvenient times.

    <br>Empire
    <br>
    <br>Empire is a free-for-all strategy game set in the late Roman Empire as various caesars take the field to win dominance. Inspired by a once-popular board game.
    <br>Each caesar starts off in one of six provinces of the empire with a small army and a fortified city.
    <br>Using his limited supply of generals to lead his troops, each expands and tries to outdo and eliminate the competition - conquer a rival caesar, and you get all his territory and troops as well.
    <br>Along the way, build and fortify cities, send war galleys across the Mediterranean, ransom or execute captive generals, and cope with rampant inflation as the cost of war doubles and triples.

    <p><b>Welcome to the world of dead reptiles and avian ancestors.</b></p>
    <p><br>The map is a low resolution image produced from NASA topological data.</p>
    <br>The globe was rotated to center Iceland on the equator before slicing it open and laying it flat.
    <br>This reduces distortions for all land, since only water remains at the poles.
    <br>A small section of turf around Greenland is used for JURASSIC.  Greenland's massive ice block makes it the perfect volcano for the Dimorphodon, one of the first Pterosaurs.
    <br>This location is impassable and the capital of Tithonia.
    <br>The players are named after the eleven periods of the Jurassic era.
    <br>Their positions on the board make game play more or less difficult.
    <br>This is reflected in the player list order with easiest on the bottom.
    <br>The top player is unique with a special dinosaur; Dimorphodon.
    <br>All other players have a full list of other dinosaurs from the Jurassic Period.
    <br>The first player is meant to be a nuisance; a leftover from the Triassic.
    <br>Even though the capital is impassable, you can still create but cannot return; like demons emerging from the pit of Hell.
    <br>
    <br>The map is colored for topological elevation and not actual vegetation conditions. Sea level after the last Ice Age, ten-thousand years ago, was nearly 400-feet lower than today.
    <br>This is easy to see as the continental shelves (light blue areas). Sadly, all that topology has been washed clean.
    <br>Territory Effects are employed to allow land reptiles to swim, and ocean dwellers to flop around on land.
    <br>Study the Effects chart in the NOTES, or snap a screen shot and place it on your desktop for reference.
    <br>Territories are labeled with a Terrain Tag. Combat is based on 12-sided dice.
    <br>All creatures looking right are defense oriented.
    <br>Each dinosaur has advantages, and the project purpose is to bring dinosaurs into the Triple-A family.

    <br>A VERY simple map.
    <br>Purpose: use these files to make your first map.  If you can make a map out of it, then you can do anything.
    <br>Basically, many people try to make these big elaborate maps as their very first map, and it often does not turn out well.  They get frustrated, have tons of bugs, and
        can't get the game to work (my very first map did not run either...).
    <br>So the idea here is that you can take all these files, run them through the map creator, and in 20 minutes you will have a working map.  If you can make it work without bugs,
        and it runs, then you better understand the development process for maps and go apply what you learned here to the map you always wanted to make.

    <br>Version 1.3 for TripleA 1.9.0.0.13066
    <br>
    <p style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF">
        In Twelve Clans (a Shogun type variant heavily inspired by the Samurai Warriors series of games) fight to expand your clan and become the dominant power in Japan.
        As you conquer rival clans, they will become your vassals (allied to you), but your vassals' true loyalties belong only to their own clan's interests.
        A clan will become vassal to another for self-preservation. If another clan conquers one of your vassals, their allegiance will change to the conquering clan.
        However, if you are conquered, your vassals will join you in switching sides.
    </p><br>
    <h3 style="font-size:16px;color:F0D06B">Victory Conditions:</h3>
    <p style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF">
        Once you are defeated, you simply switch sides. If one of your allies wins then you win a minor victory.
        Beware! No one trusts a traitor, and if you or another clan switch sides to many times, you will likely be shown no mercy should your capital fall again...
        There can only be one shogun. If a player conquers 7 rival clans that player achieves Total Victory, becoming the shogun. Any players who are not the first 7 to join the shogun have lost.
    </p><br>
    <h3 style="font-size:16px;color:F0D06B">Other Game Modes:</h3>
    <p style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF">
        In the 2 (Sekigahara), 3 (Coalitions), 4 (Triads) and 6 (Bloodpact) player alliance variants included the Vassal system is removed and the traditional alliance
        system is in place. You can choose to play this like any other game where multiple players can be a part of any particular alliance or one player can control
        the entire alliance. Once a clan is taken out in these variants, they are out for good. Victory in these variants is based on alliance control of 10, 9, 8, or 8
        clan strongholds respectively (or all 12 if you are feeling frisky).

   <br>A new version of World War II v3 that uses a small, steady flow of cash instead of a large initial bid to balance the game for the Allies.
   <br>New national objectives encourage players to compete in both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters, with front lines appearing in historically plausible regions like the Solomon Islands, Eastern Ukraine, and Norway.
   <br>China is preserved as a playable country with a modest setup change and an increased ability to collect reinforcements, including artillery from the Burma Road.
   <br>Otherwise, unit types, regions, etc. have all been preserved so that players can take advantage of their previous experience with the World War II v3 map.
   <br>Initial playtesting with human opponents suggests that the map is balanced without a bid -- but the TripleA community will be the ultimate judge.

    <br>Mistress of Italy, Rome, looking over the sea, discovers herself engaged in the inexorable struggle for survival against the might of Carthage, encroaching on Africa and Spain, and the islands nearby, as far as the columns of Hercules, the end of the World.
    <br>In Greece, the royal hegemony of Macedonia is bitterly challenged by a warring coalition of free cities and leagues, from Sicily, in the west, to Asia, in the east.
    <br>Across what remains of what was taken by Alexander, what had begun as a spate of civil conflicts conflated into a dynastic strife between the new realms of Egypt and Syria.
    <br>Beyond the Hellenistic world, the ascendancy of Parthia looms on the horizon, eager to champion the resurgence of Persian supremacy to her former greatness.
    <br>Meanwhile, hailing from unknown lands, the tribes of Numidia are swarming out of the wilds of Libya, their savage want for slaves and violent desire for booty, unquenchable.
    <br>'Tis a clash of civilizations: for either side, the other side is to be eliminated.
    <br>
    <br>Special thanks to Navalland, guerrilla_J and Aposteles for play-testing.

    <br>It is April 6th, 1917. The United States has just declared war on Germany, bringing her into the war that has engulfed Europe for the past 3 years.
    <br>Germany and Austria-Hungary expand aggressively while the Ottomans struggle just to hold on.
    <br>Greece remains officially neutral even as Entente troops flood in to liberate their Balkan allies.

    <br>Britain incites the Arabs to revolt against their Ottoman overlords while moving troops to assist France.
    <br>Unless the United States does the same, the Central Powers will soon overrun Europe.

    <br>* A medium-weight global WWII map set in 1939 or 1942
    <br>* Multiple plausible factory sites let players hold chokepoints with infantry, not fighter planes.
    <br>* Russia is strong enough to hold territory and counter-attack for most of the game even without help.
    <br>* A new roster of unit types uses no special rules -- each unit is entirely defined by its combat & movement stats
    <br>* All islands are worth at least $1 and most touch at least two sea zones, so they are useful even without a naval base / airbase
    <br>* Initial setup and territory values strongly encourage play in both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters in each game
    <br>* The game is fully playable but may be unbalanced because it needs more human playtesters; I am actively seeking comments on game balance.
    <br>*  See https://www.axisandallies.org/forums/topic/33233/argo-s-middleweight-map-for-1939-1942?page=1 for development notes.
