## General
We are all just humans and we all make mistakes, but please be polite in conversations, and follow the golden rule.

## Pull Requests
We appreciate every new developer who wants to contribute to the TripleA project.
If you want to create a Pull Request, please make sure your PR matches our requirements:
1. Make sure your PR follows our [code guidelines](https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/blob/master/docs/dev/code_standards.md)
2. Make sure your PR follows our [code formatting guidelines](https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/blob/master/docs/dev/code_format.md)
3. Make sure you understand our [process of reviewing](https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/blob/master/docs/dev/code_reviews.md)

Every PR is validated with travis, an automated build service.
If this build fails (and it's not because of some occasional server outages),  you are required to change something so the build passes.

## Issues
Open an issue if you want to report a bug or request a feature.
If it's a severe bug we are probably going to fix it pretty fast but feature requests have a pretty low priority in comparison.
Nobody is getting paid for this, so please be aware that we are not always able to respond on the same day as we are all doing this in our free time.
