Hints for customization:

1) Alternative relief tiles are available for 1-click installation (similar to map installation) in the repository. After being downloaded, they can easily be selected from the menu "View" under "Map Skins" from within TripleA, once the normal map is loaded.

2) An alternative flag sets also exists. It is already included with the version. To activate it, the current "flags" folder of NWO has to be renamed into something different, and the folder "flags_alternative" needs to become "flags".

3) A folder containing the old .gif versions of the flags is included for downward compatibility (finishing savegames). To activate it, the current "flags" folder of NWO has to be renamed into something different, and the folder "Flags_as_needed_for_old_TripleA_versions" needs to become "flags".

4) Alternate base tiles are available.  Simply switch the names of baseTiles and baseTiles2 folders.  The game will use whichever is called "baseTiles"

5) Alternate national colors are available.  Simply switch the names of map.properties and map.properties2.  The game will use whichever is called "map.properties", so you can customize it with a text editor if you wish.


Enjoy,
