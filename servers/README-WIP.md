/servers folder is a WIP

The folder will contain a subdirectory for each server that we will be deploying.

Currently we have things bundled as largely just one server.

This folder is not yet used, it is a start of an effort to break this up and re-organize
the code a bit to be yet more modular.

Further, with very specific sub-folders and more executables, we will have more opportunity
to do continuous deployments on any update without having to worry for example about
disconnecting everyone from chat.
